        180 students, the institution has rapidly grown to 8491 students and 452
        faculty representing 18 academic departments. In the three decades of

        <h2>Drone Technology for Agricultural Mission</h2>
        <p class="paraf">
          The use of drones in almost every sector of the economy is growing
          fast, but drone usage in the agricultural industry is booming.
          According to some reports, the agricultural drone market is expected
          to grow from a $1.2 billion(USD) industry in 2019 to $4.8 billion in
          2024. From scouting to security, drone use will become more ubiquitous
          on large and small scale farms in a few short years. The information
          gathered by drones on farms is often used to better inform agronomic
          decisions and is part of a system generally referred to as ‘precision
          agriculture’.
